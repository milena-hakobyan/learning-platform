# Comparison of execute(query, Object... args) and execute(query, Consumer<PreparedStatement>)

## 1. Flexibility

**Object... args:**

- Less flexible, only supports setting parameters in order.
- Does not allow for complex `PreparedStatement` manipulations, such as batch operations or custom parameter handling.

**Consumer<PreparedStatement>:**

- Highly flexible; caller can manipulate the statement fully (set parameters conditionally, execute multiple times, handle specific JDBC features).
- Enables use cases that require advanced control.

## 2. Safety and Encapsulation

**Object... args:**

- Utility fully controls the execution lifecycle (prepare, set, execute, close).
- Better encapsulation, reduces risk of resource leaks or incorrect usage.

**Consumer<PreparedStatement>:**

- Exposes the internal `PreparedStatement` to the caller, increasing risk of misuse.
- Caller might forget to execute or close resources properly if extended beyond the method scope (though try-with-resources helps).
